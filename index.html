        <pre class="conatiner">If there 's one situation where boys do show empathy, compassion,
             and openness, it's when they 're with their best friends. And that type of relationship
              has to be protected: In a report published 
              in the Journal of Research on Adolescence,
        NYU Professor Niobe Way found that more than 85% of American adolescent boys
        , interviewed over more
         than 20 years, described their close male friendships as a kind of deep and emotion-based love</pre></p><br><br>

    <p><pre>Boys, like girls, crave connection and belonging.
         Like all of us, boys need friends, suffer 
         when they don't believe they have any,
          and agonize over the ups and downs of relationships
          . Many adults believe that somehow boys need friends less than girls do;
           the myth of the stoic male has intruded even into childhood. 
           In truth, though, no boy is an island;
            boys value their friends throughout childhood and adolescence and are happier and healthier
             when they have solid relationships with peers.</pre></p>
